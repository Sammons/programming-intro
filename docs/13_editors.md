## Editors

Programmers get really passionate about the tools they use and the way that they use them.

VIM and Emacs have been fighting for decades even though new editors are still around. Whatever works best for you is the best for you, but this is worth some discussion.

There are technically "Text Editors" and then "Integration Development Environments" which are more comprehensive. The lines are blurry these days so we're really talking about IDEs.

__Modern Features__

These features are common to new editors

* Multi-line editing
* Git integration
* Integrated terminal

__General Features__

These features are generally expected to be present

* Intellisense for your language (auto-complete)
* Integrated test runner
* line-by-line Debugging support

## Recommendations

If you are on windows, I recommend Visual Studio because of its integrations with so many languages and comprehensive debugging experience.

Otherwise, I recommend Visual Studio Code as long as you are not writing C++ or Java. If you are using one of those then I recommend CLion or IntelliJ from JetBrains.

VS Code (Visual Studio Code) is light weight, easy to install, and provides a relatively painless experience compared to other options.

VIM: Everyone has to use VIM at some point, but I do not recommend it as a daily driver.

Nano: I recommend Nano over VIM or Emacs for remote server file editing just because it behaves consistently. I admit VIM is a close second because it is faster than nano once you get used to it.

Emacs: I only recommend Emacs to people who want to learn functional programming and have time to throw at it. Take a look at LISP and Clojure before trying this one out.
  * Functional programming is a sub-group of programming that focuses on eliminating variable re-assignment in code and treating functions like any other data.
