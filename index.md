### What is this?

This is a repository on github containing some condensed material about programming for beginners.

Read it in order, and it will hopefully make some sense. The topics are as brief as I could make them but still explain why they exist.

The idea here is to provide some knowledge, but more importantly a frame of reference for any courses or training you may be taking to learn about programming already.

So this will explain a little bit about a lot of things ranging from file systems, to operating systems, to bash commands and the difference between a compiler and an interpreter.

I attempted to follow hype to keep things relevant.

Enjoy!
